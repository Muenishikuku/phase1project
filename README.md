## Prerequisites

Before you can run this web app, ensure you have the following:

A web browser to view the application.
An internet connection to fetch country information from an external API.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in a text editor or code IDE of your choice.

## Usage

Open the project's HTML file in your web browser (e.g., index.html).
Enter the name of the country you want to look up in the input field and click the "Submit" button.
The application will fetch information about the specified country and display it on the page.

## Code Explanation

The code uses JavaScript to add an event listener to the form with the ID 'country-form,' listening for a submit event.
When the form is submitted, the JavaScript code prevents the default form submission behavior (e.preventDefault()).
It retrieves the country name from the input field and constructs a URL to fetch data from the "https://restcountries.com/v3.1" API using the fetch function.
It then processes the fetched data and displays relevant information about the country on the web page.
